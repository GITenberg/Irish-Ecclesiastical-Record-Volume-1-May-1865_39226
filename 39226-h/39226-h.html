        <span style="font-size: 173%">The See Of Derry.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The territory of
        Cineal-Eoghain, from a very early period, formed a distinct diocese,
        which took its name from the church of Arderath, now Ardstraw,
        situated on the River Derg, and founded by St. Eugene, first bishop
        of this see. In the synod of Rathbreasail, an. 1110, it is called
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Dioecesis Ardsrathensis”</span> though
        probably in that very year the city of Derry was chosen for the
        episcopal residence. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sedes
        Episcopalis”</span>, writes Dr. O'Cherballen, bishop of the see in
        1247, <span class="tei tei-q">“a tempore limitationis Episcopatuum
        Hyberniae in villa Darensi utpote uberiori et magis idoneo loco qui
        in sua Dioecesi habeatur, extitit constituta”</span>. For some years
        this arrangement continued undisturbed, till the appointment of Dr.
        O'Coffy, who about the year 1150 transferred his see to Rathlure, a
        church dedicated to St. Luroch; and subsequently, for one hundred
        years, we find the see designated <span class="tei tei-q">“Dioecesis
        Rathlurensis”</span>, or <span class="tei tei-q">“de
        Rathlurig”</span>, under which name it appears in the lists of
        Centius Camerarius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. Muredach
        O'Coffy was a canon regular of the order of St. Augustine, and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“was held in great repute for his learning,
        humility, and charity to the poor”</span>—(Ware). The old Irish
        annalists style him <span class="tei tei-q">“the sun of science; the
        precious stone and resplendent gem of knowledge; the bright star and
        rich treasury of learning; and as in charity, so too was he powerful
        in pilgrimage and prayer”</span>. He assisted at the Synod of Kells,
        which was convened by Cardinal Paparo in 1152, and in the catalogue
        of its bishops he is styled from the territory occupied by his see,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Bishop
        of Cineal-Eoghain</span></span>. His death is marked in our annals on
        the 10th of February, 1173/4.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amlaf O'Coffy
        succeeded the same year, and is also eulogized <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by our annalists as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a shining light, illuminating both clergy and
        people”</span>. He was translated to Armagh in 1184, but died the
        following year. Our ancient records add that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“his remains were brought with great solemnity to Derry
        and interred at the feet of his predecessor”</span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Florence
        O'Cherballen next governed the see, from 1185 to 1230; whilst the
        episcopate of his successor, Friar German O'Cherballen, embraced well
        nigh half a century, extending from 1230 to his death in 1279. It was
        during the administration of this last-named bishop that the
        episcopal see was once more definitively fixed in Derry. The Holy
        See, by letter of 31st May, 1247, commissioned the Bishop of Raphoe,
        the Abbot of the monastery of SS. Peter and Paul in Armagh, and the
        Prior of Louth, to investigate the reasons set forth by Dr. Germanus
        for abandoning the church of Rathlure. The following extract from the
        Papal letter preserves to us the chief motive thus alleged by Bishop
        Germanus:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

        Episcopus vel aliquis de suis canonicis residere, nec clerus ejusdem

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was also added
        by Dr. O'Cherballen, that his predecessor, O'Coffy, had himself been
        born in Rathlure, and that it was through love for his native
        district he had, by his own authority, transferred the episcopal seat
        from Derry to Rathlure (illectus natalis soli dulcedine transtulit
        motu propriae voluntatis).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The appointed
        deputies approved of the resolution taken by Bishop Germanus, and a
        few years later (1254), in reply to the Chapter of Derry, the same
        Pope Innocent IV. thus confirmed this translation of the see:</p>

        indulgences, and other special favours which it had hitherto enjoyed
        in Rathlure (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span>, pag. 48).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The successor of
        Bishop Germanus was Florence O'Cherballen, who held the see from 1279
        to 1293. Five other bishops then came in rapid succession. Henry of
        Ardagh, from 1294 to 1297; Geoffry Melaghlin, from 1297 to 1315; Hugh
        or Odo O'Neal, from 1316 to 1319; Michael Melaghlin, from 1319 to
        about 1330; and Maurice, from about 1330 to 1347.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the death of
        the last-named bishop, a Dominican, by name Symon, was appointed by
        Pope Clement VI. to rule the See of Derry. He had indeed already been
        nominated by brief, dated the 5th of the Ides of May, 1347, to the
        diocese of Clonmacnoise, but the aged and infirm bishop of that see,
        who was reported to have passed to a better life, was not yet
        deceased, and hence, on the vacancy of Derry, Bishop Symon was, by
        brief of 18th December, 1347, appointed successor of St. Eugene. From
        the first brief, which nominated him to Clonmacnoise, we learn that
        Friar Symon was Prior of the Dominican fathers of Roscommon, and was
        remarkable for his zeal, his literary proficiency, and his manifold
        virtues. The brief of his appointment to Derry adds the following
        particulars:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bishop Symon seems
        to have held the see till the close of this century, and the next
        bishop that we find was John, Abbot of Moycoscain, or <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">de claro fonte</span></span>, who was appointed
        to Derry by brief of Pope Boniface IX. on 19th August, 1401. Of his
        immediate successors we know little more than the mere names. William
        Quaplod, a Carmelite and a distinguished patron of literary men, died
        in 1421. Donald for ten years then ruled the diocese, and resigned in
        1431; his successor, John, died in 1456. A Cistercian monk, named
        Bartholomew O'Flanagan, next sat in the see for five years; and
        Nicholas Weston, a canon of Armagh, who was consecrated its bishop in
        1466, held it till his death in 1484.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Donald O'Fallon,
        an Observantine Franciscan, was advanced to this see by Pope Innocent
        VIII. on the 17th of May, 1485: <span class="tei tei-q">“he was
        reckoned a man of great reputation in his time for learning, and a
        constant course of preaching through all Ireland, which he continued
        for full thirty years”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ware</span></span>). He died in the year
        1500.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">James Mac Mahon is
        the first bishop whose name appears in the sixteenth century. He was
        Commendatory Prior of the Abbey of SS. Peter and Paul, at Knock, in
        the county Louth, and died in December, 1517.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">William Hogeson,
        which is probably a corruption of the Irish name <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">O'Gashin</span></span>,
        was appointed his successor by Pope Leo X. on 8th of August, 1520. He
        belonged to the order of St. Dominic, and seems to have administered
        the see till 1529.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Roderick or Rory
        O'Donnell, Dean of Raphoe, was chosen by Pope Clement VII., on 19th
        September, 1529, to occupy the see of Derry. This bishop was very
        much opposed to the religious innovations which Henry VIII.
        endeavoured to introduce into the Irish Church. In the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">State
        Papers</span></span> (vol. i. pag. 598) there is a letter dated 14th
        March, 1539, and addressed by Lord Cromwell to the English king, in
        which the following eulogy is passed on Dr. O'Donnell: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Also there be letters long from an arrant traitor,
        Rorick, Bishop of Derry, in your grace's land of Ireland, his hand
        and great seal at it, to the Bishop of Rome, declaring the calamities
        of the Papists in Ireland”</span>. It was in the preceding year that
        Bishop Roderick had mortally offended the agents of King Henry by his
        efforts to preserve from their grasp the youthful Gerald, who, though
        yet in his boyhood, was chief of the Geraldines, and destined, it was
        hoped, to become one day the rallying point of a confederacy of the
        Irish chieftains. In the month of May Gerald and his faithful escort
        passed without <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg
        357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        molestation from the south to the north of Ireland, being hospitably
        received in Thomond, Galway, and Sligo; and they were safely
        entrenched within the barriers of Tyrconnell before the government
        spies had even caught the intelligence of this journey. On the 28th
        of June the Earl of Ormonde wrote a long letter to the council of
        Ireland, giving information of the movements of young Gerald. From
        this letter we learn that it was an Irish rhymist that acted as his
        spy amongst the Northern chieftains, and that, according to the
        latest intelligence received from him, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“twenty-four horsemen, well apparrelled”</span>, had been
        appointed to wait upon the young Geraldine. The King of Scotland,
        too, solicited the Irish princes to commit Gerald to his care.
        However, in another letter, of 20th July, the same earl writes that
        this scheme was not pleasing to O'Neil and O'Donnell, but
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Bishop O'Donnell (of Derry), James
        Delahoyde, Master Levrous, and Robert Walshe, are gone as messengers
        to Scotland, to pray aid from the Scottish king; and before their
        going, all the gentlemen of Ulster, for the most part, promised to
        retain as many Scots as they should bring with them, at their own
        expense and charges during the time of their service in
        Ireland”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">St. Pap.</span></span>, iii. 52). Another
        information further states that as a Christmas present in December,
        1538, Art Oge O'Toole had sent to Gerald <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        saffron shirt trimmed with silk, and a mantle of English cloth
        fringed with silk, together with a sum of money”</span>—(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ibid.</span></span>,
        pag. 139). And a few months later Cowley writes from Dublin to the
        English court, that <span class="tei tei-q">“there never was seen in
        Ireland so great a host of Irishmen and Scots, both of the out isles
        and of the mainland of Scotland; whilst at the same time the
        pretended Earl of Desmond has all the strength of the
        west”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ibid.</span></span>, pag. 145). It is not
        necessary to pursue the subsequent events of this confederacy, as we
        have no express documents to attest the share taken in it by the
        Bishop of Derry. One further fact alone connected with our great
        prelate has been recorded by our annalists, and it, too, regards the
        closing scene of his eventful life, viz., that before his death he
        wished to become a member of the Franciscan order, and dying on the
        8th of October, 1550, <span class="tei tei-q">“he was buried in the
        monastery of Donegal in the habit of St.
        Francis”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Four Mast.</span></span>, v. 1517).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eugene Magennis,
        the next bishop, governed the see from 1551 to 1568. It was during
        his episcopate that the venerable church and monastery of St.
        Colomba, together with the town of Derry, were reduced to a heap of
        ruins. The fact is thus narrated by Cox: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Colonel Saintlow succeeded Randolph in the command of
        the garrison, and lived as quietly as could be desired; for the
        rebels were so daunted by the former defeat that they did not dare to
        make any new attempt; but unluckily, on the 24th <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> day of April (1566), the ammunition took
        fire, and blew up both the town and the fort of Derry, whereby twenty
        men were killed, and all the victuals and provisions were destroyed,
        and no possibility left of getting more, so that the soldiers were
        necessitated to embark for Dublin”</span>—(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hist.</span></span>,
        part i. pag. 322). This disaster was regarded at the time as a divine
        chastisement for the profanation of St. Columba's church and cell,
        the latter being used by the heretical soldiery as a repository of
        ammunition, whilst the former was defiled by their profane
        worship—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">O'Sulliv.</span></span>, pag. 96).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next bishop
        was Raymond O'Gallagher, who, when receiving the administration of
        the see of Killala, in 1545, is described in the Consistorial Acts as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“clericus dioecesis Rapotensis in
        vigesimotertio anno constitutus”</span>. It was also commanded that
        after four years, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> when he would have attained
        his twenty-seventh year, he should be consecrated Bishop of Killala.
        In 1569, he was translated from that see to Derry, which he ruled
        during the many perils and persecutions of Elizabeth's reign, till,
        as Mooney writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“omnium Episcoporurm
        Europae ordinatione antiquissimus”</span>, he died, full of years, on
        the 15th of March in 1601. In a government memorial of 28th July,
        1592, Dr. O'Gallagher is thus noticed: <span class="tei tei-q">“First
        in Ulster is one Redmondus O'Gallagher, Bishop of Derry.... The said
        Bishop O'Gallagher hath been with divers governors of that land upon
        protection, and yet he is supposed to enjoy the bishoprick and all
        the aforesaid authorities these xxvi years and more, whereby it is to
        be understood that he is not there as a man without authority and
        secretly kept”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Kilken. Proceedings</span></span>, May, 1856,
        pag. 80). The xxvi of this passage has led many into error as to the
        date of Dr. O'Gallagher's appointment to Derry, which, reckoning back
        from 1592, should be placed in 1567. However, that numeral probably
        is a misprint for xxiii, such mistakes being very frequent in the
        mediaeval manuscripts, as well as in more modern publications. The
        following extract from the papers of Cardinal Morone in the Vatican
        archives, will serve to show that in 1569 the see was vacant by the
        death of Bishop Eugenius:—</p>

        however, was the person chosen by the Holy See, and was proclaimed in
        consistory before the close of 1569. A few years later we find
        faculties communicated to him by Rome for his own diocese, and for
        the whole province of Armagh, <span class="tei tei-q">“quamdiu
        venerabilis frater Richardus Archiepiscopus Armachanus impeditus a

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ex. Secret.

        Hist.</span></span>, pag. 1213); and we soon after meet with him in
        the camp of O'Donnell, when that chieftain was gathering his forces
        to cut short the military career of General Norris: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There were there”</span>, writes O'Sullivan,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“some ecclesiastics, and especially Raymond
        O'Gallagher, Bishop of Derry, and Vice-Primate of Ireland, who

        army”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Hist. Cath.</span></span>, p. 181). It was in
        1596 that Norris set out with about 10,000 men to invade North
        Connaught and Tyrconnell. That general was flushed with his victories
        in France and Belgium, nevertheless he was obliged to ignominiously
        retreat from the Ulster frontiers, being unable even to bring to
        battle the chosen army of 5,000 men which was led by the brave
        O'Donnel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this evidence
        before him, the reader may fully appreciate the favourite modern
        theory of the defenders of the Protestant Establishment, that,
        forsooth, the Irish bishops during Elizabeth's reign abandoned the
        faith of their fathers, and became liege servants of the church by
        law established! Dr. Cotton when speaking of our see makes a somewhat
        more reserved, but equally erroneous statement: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Redmond O'Gallagher”</span>, he says, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“was bishop at this time, but whether recognised as such
        by Queen Elizabeth and the Protestant Church <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does not
        appear</span></em>”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Fasti</span></span>, iii. 315). Why, it does
        appear as plainly as the noon-day sun that he was the determined
        enemy of the Protestant queen and her establishment: throughout his
        whole episcopate he was a devoted pastor of the Catholic Church, and
        thus his fidelity and devotion to the cause of God merited for him in
        death the martyr's crown. First on the list of those who suffered for
        the faith during the reign of Elizabeth is reckoned by Dr. Mathews,
        Archbishop of Dublin, in 1623, <span class="tei tei-q">“Redmondus
        Galluthurius Darensis Episcopus et Martyr”</span>—(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Relat. ad. S. C. de
        Prop. Fid.</span></span>) Mooney, writing in 1617, also styles him a
        martyr: <span class="tei tei-q">“Episcopus Redmondus Gallaher martyr
        obiit anno 1601”</span>; and O'Sullivan Beare, about the same time,
        adds some of the circumstances of his death: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Raymundus O'Gallacher”</span>, he writes, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Derii vel Luci Episcopus, ab Anglis bipennibus
        confessus, et capite truncatus annum circiter octogesimum
        agens”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Hist. Cath.</span></span>, pag. 77). The Four
        Masters (ad an. 1601) also mention his being put to death by the
        English; and Rothe reckons him amongst those who suffered for the
        faith. Tradition still points out the spot on which the venerable
        bishop was slain, almost midway on the high road between O'Kane's
        Castle and Dungiven. (See Dr. Kelly's <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essays</span></span>,
        with the additions of Dr. M'Carthy: Dublin, 1864, pag. 425).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It now only
        remains to notice some few popular errors connected with this
        see.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. On account of
        the old Latin form of the name of this see, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Darensis</span></span>, it has frequently been
        confounded with the Diocese of Kildare. Thus, not to mention more
        recent examples, Ware severely criticises Bale of Ossory for falling
        into this mistake—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Bishops</span></span>, pag. 190). The chief
        criterion for distinguishing between the two sees, is the mention
        which is generally made of the metropolitan to whom the brief is
        addressed, or of the ecclesiastical province to which the diocese
        belongs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. Dr. King
        notices as an improbability that O'Gallagher could have been bishop
        for fifty-two years, and, nevertheless, be only (as Dr. King
        imagines) seventy years of age at his death. However, true dates are
        sure always to mutually correspond. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Referring to the Consistorial Acts, cited
        above, it appears that in 1545 Dr. O'Gallagher was in his
        twenty-third year, and that a dispensation was then granted to him to
        be consecrated bishop in his twenty-seventh year: hence, at his death
        in 1601, Dr. O'Gallagher may very well have attained the fifty-second
        year of his Episcopate, whilst he will be found, not indeed in his
        seventieth year, but, as O'Sullivan writes, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“circa octogesimum annum agens”</span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The succession
        of bishops in the See of Derry affords a practical refutation of the
        novel theory so fashionable now-a-days amongst the clergy of the
        Establishment, that forsooth the native clergy without hesitation
        embraced the tenets of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, and that the
        Catholic Church was only upheld in our island <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“by begging friars and foreign priests”</span>. We pray
        the reader whenever he hears such a statement made, to call to mind
        the See of Derry. Was Roderick, <span class="tei tei-q">“the arrant
        traitor”</span>, in the days of King Henry, a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foreign
        priest</span></em> and a stranger to our island? Was Raymond
        O'Gallagher a foreigner during Elizabeth's reign? Oh! ask the
        faithful of Innishowen, amongst whom he first exercised his sacred
        ministry—ask the camps of Maguire, O'Donnell, and O'Neill! Ask, too,
        the very enemies of our holy faith, the first founders of the
        Protestant Establishment: their deeds will tell you that he was the
        true pastor of the fold, and hence they set a price upon his head,
        and at length conferred on him the martyr's crown.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was,
        however, one foreign prelate who received an appointment in Derry at
        this period, and he was precisely <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first</span></em>
        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">only</span></em> Protestant nominee to this see
        during Elizabeth's reign. <span class="tei tei-q">“To the two
        northern sees of Raphoe and Derry”</span>, writes Dr. Mant,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Elizabeth made no collation, unless in the
        year 1595, when her reign was drawing towards its
        close”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Hist.</span></span>, i. 284). George Montgomery,
        a Scotchman, was the individual thus chosen to be the first
        representative of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Establishment</span></em> in our northern sees.
        His patent for the sees of Clogher, Derry, and Raphoe, was dated the
        13th of June, 1595, where already for many years a canonically
        appointed bishop ruled the fold of Christ. The good sense, however,
        of the Knoxian reformer judged it more prudent not to risk himself
        and family amidst the O'Kanes whilst arms were in the hands of the
        Irish chieftains: he hence consigned to oblivion his royal patent,
        and allowed the Irish pastors to feed in peace their spiritual fold.
        Even when, in 1605, he sought for a new appointment to these sees at
        the hands of King James, as we learn from Mant, Ware, and other
        Protestant authorities, he took care to make no allusion to the writ
        which he had formerly received in the thirty-seventh year of
        Elizabeth.</p>

        II.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Colenso
        controversy has entered on a new phase. It appears we must no longer
        speak of Dr. Colenso as the Protestant Bishop of Natal. He enjoyed
        this title indeed for a time, in virtue of letters patent issued by
        the supreme head of the Established Church. But the judicial
        committee of her Majesty's privy council has sat in judgment on her
        Majesty's letters patent, and has just pronounced that they are
        invalid and without effect in law; that her Majesty had assumed a
        prerogative which did not belong to her, and had been guilty in fact,
        though inadvertently, of an illegal aggression upon the rights of her
        colonists.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The history of
        this remarkable decision may be told in a few words. Dr Colenso was
        appointed to the See of Natal in the year 1853. In the same year, Dr.
        Gray, as Bishop of Cape Town, was invested by royal letters patent
        with metropolitan jurisdiction over Dr. Colenso and the diocese of
        Natal. Ten years passed away, and each in his own sphere exercised
        the authority which he was supposed to have received from the crown.
        At length Dr. Colenso's book appears, and a charge of heresy is
        preferred against him. The charge is entertained by the supposed
        metropolitan, who sets up a court, proceeds to try the cause, and
        finally, in December, 1863, delivers his sentence. By this sentence
        Dr. Colenso is deprived of his see, and forbidden to exercise his
        sacred functions within the ecclesiastical province of Cape Town. The
        deposed bishop refuses to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court,
        and appeals to the privy council. The controversy was thus reduced to
        a simple question of law,—was Dr. Gray legally possessed of those
        metropolitan rights to which he laid claim? To this question the
        judicial committee of the privy council has given a clear and
        decisive answer. When a colony is once endowed with legislative
        institutions of its own, the crown no longer possesses any authority
        to create sees or to confer ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Now in the
        two colonies of Cape Town and Natal an independent legislature had
        been established in the year 1850; and therefore the letters patent
        of 1853 were null and void in law. Hence it follows that, according
        to English law, Dr. Gray was never in point of fact the Metropolitan
        of Cape Town; but neither was Dr. Colenso the Bishop of Natal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus has Dr.
        Colenso pulled down the whole edifice of the English colonial
        episcopate. Like Sampson of old, he has been, indeed, avenged upon
        his enemies, but he has been himself crushed beneath the ruins he has
        made. Yet, though his jurisdiction <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> as a bishop may be taken away, his moral power
        and his influence are increased. He now appears not only as an
        eminent leader of the free-thinking and infidel school of theology,
        but as a martyr who has suffered in the cause; and this new character
        gives him an additional claim to the sympathy and veneration of his
        followers. When the youthful plant is checked in its upward growth by
        the skilful knife of the gardener, it puts forth new branches on
        every side, and flourishes with increased luxuriance. And so,
        according to every human probability, the check which Dr. Colenso has
        received will but promote the rapid expansion of his views, and their
        dissemination throughout the Protestant Church. It is therefore all
        the more important for those who defend the cause of truth to refute
        his charges against the Bible, and to lay bare the sophistry of his
        arguments. Let us take the following example:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. Colenso revels
        in figures. When he sets about a problem he delights to look at it
        from every point of view, and to work out his sum in a variety of
        ways. By a very simple process of multiplication and addition he has
        here proved that the Scripture narrative is quite ridiculous and
        absurd. Yet he is not content. He must lead his readers to the same
        conclusion by another process:—</p>

        necessary for the purpose for which they were summoned on this

        inside the tabernacle itself, and could only, therefore, be seen by
        those standing at the door....</span></span></p>

          30 yards) was 1,800 square yards, and the area of the tabernacle
          itself (18 yards by 6 yards) was 108 square yards. Hence the area
          of the court outside the tabernacle was 1,692 square yards. But the
          whole congregation would have made a body of people nearly twenty
          miles—or, more accurately, 33,530 yards—long, and 18 feet or 6
          yards wide; that is to say, packed closely together, they would
          have covered an area of 201,180 square yards. In fact the court,
          when thronged, could only have held five thousand people; whereas

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before we proceed
        to examine this singular objection, put forward in so plausible and
        popular a form, it may be useful to describe, in a few words, the
        general appearance of the tabernacle, and of the court which
        surrounded it. Our readers will thus be placed in a position to form
        a clear and distinct idea of the difficulty which Dr. Colenso has
        raised. And we are satisfied that the more thoroughly it is
        understood, the more complete and satisfactory will the explanation
        be found.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The court of the
        tabernacle was an oblong rectangle, one hundred <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> cubits<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2"
        href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> in
        length, from east to west, and fifty cubits in breadth, from north to
        south. This space was enclosed by hangings of fine twisted linen,
        supported by sixty pillars, to which they were attached by hooks and
        fillets of silver. The entrance to the court was at the eastern end;
        it was twenty cubits in width; and across the opening was suspended a
        curtain, embroidered with fancy needlework, and rich with gorgeous
        colours.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within the court,
        and towards the western end, was erected the tabernacle. It was
        simply a large tent, constructed with elaborate care, and formed of
        costly materials. Like the court in which it was placed, it was an
        oblong rectangle, being thirty cubits in length and ten cubits in
        breadth. The walls were of setim or acacia wood; the roof of fine
        linen, covered with curtains of goats' hair and skins. The eastern
        end was open, but was furnished with a rich hanging to serve as a
        door. Internally the tabernacle was divided by a veil into two
        apartments;—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Holy Place</span></span>, twenty cubits in
        length, which contained the golden candlestick, the table of
        show-bread, and the altar of incense; and the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Holy of
        Holies</span></span>, ten cubits in length, in which was placed the
        ark of the covenant. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Holy Place</span></span> was appropriated to the
        priests, who entered it twice a day, morning and evening. The
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Holy of
        Holies</span></span> was forbidden to all but the high priest alone,
        and even he could enter only once a year, on the great day of
        atonement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The argument of
        Dr. Colenso is now easily understood. According to the Scripture
        narrative, the whole multitude of the Israelites, or at least six
        hundred thousand men, were summoned to attend, and actually did
        attend, <span class="tei tei-q">“at the door of the
        tabernacle”</span>. It follows that they must have stood in a line
        eighteen feet broad and twenty miles long, which is perfectly absurd.
        Besides, they could not have witnessed the ceremony to which they
        were summoned unless they came within the court. But this is an
        absolute impossibility, as the court would only hold five thousand
        men, even if they were closely packed together.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here is, indeed, a
        very serious charge against the credibility of the Pentateuch. But it
        seems to us a charge which, from its very nature, must refute itself.
        Dr. Colenso will not deny that the Book of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leviticus</span></span>
        was written while the tabernacle was still in existence; and that its
        author, whoever he may have been, had the tabernacle and its
        appurtenances constantly before his eyes. If he was not a truthful
        historian, but an impostor, he was certainly <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> a most skilful impostor. He must have known
        well, all his readers must have known well—quite as well as Dr.
        Colenso—that the tabernacle could not hold more than five thousand
        people. Now it is perfectly incredible that any man of common sense,
        not to say a most clever and successful impostor, under these
        circumstances, would have ventured boldly to state that six hundred
        thousand persons were gathered within its precincts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us, however,
        examine the argument in detail. The foundation on which it rests is
        clearly enough stated by Dr. Colenso. <span class="tei tei-q">“It
        appears to be certain that by the expressions, used so often here and
        elsewhere, <span class="tei tei-q">‘the assembly’</span>,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘the whole assembly’</span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘all the congregation’</span>, is meant the whole body of
        the people—at all events, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">adult males in the prime of life</span></em>
        among them—and not merely the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">elders</span></em> or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heads of the
        people</span></em>”</span>, etc. We deny this assertion. The Hebrew
        word עדה (heda), which is here translated the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assembly</span></em>,
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">congregation</span></em>, comes from the root
        יעד (yahad), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">to appoint</span></em>, and means literally an
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assembly
        meeting by appointment</span></em>. It is quite true, as Dr. Colenso
        contends, that the word is sometimes employed to designate the entire
        body of the people. But it is also true, though he ignores the fact,
        that it is sometimes applied to a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">select
        few</span></em>, invested with a certain authority and jurisdiction.
        We shall be content with submitting to our readers one remarkable
        example.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
        thirty-fifth chapter of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Numbers</span></span> we read of the cities of
        refuge. They were to be six in number—three upon each side of the
        Jordan; and were intended to afford shelter to those who had
        unintentionally shed innocent blood. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
        they shall be for you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the
        manslayer die not until he stand before the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assembly</span></em>
        (עדה) for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">judgment</span></em>”</span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Numbers</span></span>,
        xxxv. 12).<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
        "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> It is
        then laid down that if the murder have been deliberate, it shall be
        punished with death (16-21). But if the fatal blow have been struck
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without
        enmity</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">premeditation</span></em>, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by chance</span></em>
        (22, 23), <span class="tei tei-q">“then the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assembly</span></em>
        (עדה) shall <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">judge</span></em> between the slayer and the
        revenger of blood.... And the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">assembly</span></em> (עדה) shall deliver the
        slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assembly</span></em>
        (עדה) shall restore him to the city of his refuge”</span> (24, 25).
        It is quite impossible to suppose that the judicial tribunal here
        spoken of could be the entire body of the people, or even the 600,000
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368"
        id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> male adults. The question to
        be tried was one of the highest moment, involving the life or death
        of a fellow-citizen. It was also one of extreme delicacy, having to
        deal, not with the mere external act, but with the motives and
        feelings of the heart. To the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">assembly</span></em> (עדה) it belonged to
        pronounce, not merely whether one man had killed another, but whether
        in his heart he had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">committed the crime</span></em> of murder. For
        this purpose witnesses should be examined, evidence should be
        carefully sifted, and, perhaps, even the domestic secrets of the
        accused and of his victim should be laid bare. Was this a task that
        could be entrusted to a mixed multitude of 600,000 men?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly we
        find that Rosenmuller, in his commentary on this passage
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Num.</span></span>, xxxv. 24), explains the
        word, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        assembly of judges</span></em>—<span class="tei tei-q">“cætus judicum
        urbis in cujus agro contigerit homicidium”</span>. If we apply this
        interpretation to the passage in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leviticus</span></span>,
        every shadow of improbability and inconsistency will at once
        disappear from the narrative. Now, we ask Dr. Colenso, when a word in
        Scriptural usage has two different meanings, which must we choose
        when we come to examine a text in which that word is found? Are we to
        select the meaning which is in every way suitable to the context and
        circumstances; or must we rather adopt an interpretation which will
        make the sense absurd and impossible? Dr. Colenso has preferred the
        latter course. It appears to us that the former is alone consistent
        with the instinct of common sense and the principles of genuine
        criticism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We think our
        readers will admit that we have fairly established our point, and
        proved that Dr. Colenso's argument is utterly destitute of
        foundation. For the ordinary purposes of controversy it would be
        unnecessary to go further. But we frankly confess we aim at something
        more. We are not content with answering the argument of Dr. Colenso;
        we wish to shake his authority as a trustworthy critic. All that he
        has written against the Pentateuch is made up of these two
        elements—first, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">meaning</span></em> which he attaches to the
        narrative, and, secondly, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">process of reasoning</span></em> by which he
        labours to show that this meaning is inconsistent or impossible. Now
        it is plain, from the argument we are considering, that Dr. Colenso
        is liable to the grossest errors, not only when he undertakes to
        interpret the sacred text, but also when he proceeds to reason on his
        own interpretation. If this assertion be established, his authority
        can have but little weight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us suppose
        then, for a moment, that by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">assembly</span></em> is meant, in a general way,
        the entire people of Israel; does it follow, as Dr. Colenso
        maintains, that, according to the narrative, 600,000 men must have
        <span class="tei tei-q">“hastened to present themselves at the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369"
        id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">‘door
        of the tabernacle?’</span> ”</span> We believe it does not. Nay,
        more, we believe that the absurdity of Dr. Colenso's opinion is
        clearly proved by some of the texts which he has himself adduced. For
        instance:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Bring forth the blasphemer out of
        the camp ... and let <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all the assembly</span></em> (עדה) stone
        him”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Lev.</span></span>, xxiv. 14). And again, in the
        case of the Sabbath-breaker:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The man shall
        be surely put to death; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all the assembly</span></em> (עדה) shall stone
        him with stones without the camp. And <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the
        assembly</span></em> (עדה) brought him without the camp, and stoned
        him with stones, and he died”</span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Num.</span></span>, xv.
        35, 36). No one will maintain that the writer here means to say that
        600,000 men were engaged in carrying the condemned man, or that
        600,000 men threw stones at him. If Dr. Colenso had paused for a
        moment to reflect on these texts as he copied them from the Bible, we
        are convinced he would have suppressed his foolish argument. Exactly
        as it is said that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all the assembly</span></em> was gathered into
        the door of the tabernacle, so too is it said that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the
        assembly</span></em> stoned the blasphemer and the Sabbath-breaker.
        In the latter case, it is clear that the number of those who were
        actually engaged in carrying out the sentence of God was
        comparatively small, but the act is fairly ascribed to the whole
        community, because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all</span></em> were <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">summoned</span></em>
        to take part in it, and those who complied with the summons
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">represented</span></em> those who did not.
        Surely there is no reason why we may not apply the same
        interpretation to the former passage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor is this mode
        of speaking peculiar to Sacred Scripture. Every year the members of
        the House of Commons are summoned to appear at the bar of the House
        of Lords; every year we are told that they obey that summons. Who is
        there that questions the truth of this statement? It represents a
        fact with which we are all familiar. Yet Dr. Colenso with his rule
        and measure will demonstrate that the fact is impossible and the
        statement false, because the place in which the Commons are said to
        assemble cannot possibly hold one-tenth of their number.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for Dr.
        Colenso as an interpreter of the Bible. He is satisfied that if we
        accept the narrative we must believe that six hundred thousand men
        were gathered unto the door of the tabernacle. We have seen that he
        is mistaken; but let us now concede this fact, and let us see how he
        proceeds to reason upon it. Since the tabernacle was only eighteen
        feet wide, this immense multitude must have stood in a line eighteen
        feet in breadth and twenty miles in length. This is certainly a most
        extraordinary conclusion. No multitude ever yet stood in such a line;
        no multitude <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">could</span></em> stand in such a line unless
        they had been specially trained during many years for that purpose.
        There is no conceivable reason why the Jews on this occasion should
        have stood <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg
        370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        such a line. And yet Dr. Colenso will have it that they <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> have
        stood in this way, if it be true that they were gathered unto the
        door of the tabernacle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are tempted to
        offer an illustration of the very peculiar manner in which Dr.
        Colenso here pursues his critical examination of the Bible. Many of
        our readers will remember the 15th of August, 1843. In the
        phraseology of Scripture it might be said that upon that day 100,000
        Irishmen were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gathered to O'Connell</span></em> on the Hill of
        Tara.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> To the
        ordinary reader such a statement would present no insuperable
        difficulty. It would convey, indeed, a pretty correct idea of what we
        all know actually to have taken place. But when submitted to the
        Colenso process, this simple narrative will be found to undergo a
        very startling transformation. O'Connell did not occupy a space more
        than two feet broad. Therefore there was just room for one full-grown
        man to stand in front of him. The second must have stood behind the
        first; the third behind the second; and so the whole multitude must
        have extended in a single unbroken line over many miles of country. A
        little boy at school could tell us that, when we say the multitude
        was gathered unto O'Connell, we do not mean that the multitude
        occupied a space which was only as broad as O'Connell. Yet Dr.
        Colenso maintains that this is the only meaning which the phrase
        admits. Such principles would make strange havoc with history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, Dr. Colenso
        contends that all who were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gathered unto the door of the
        tabernacle</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“must have come
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within the
        court</span></em>”</span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“This,
        indeed”</span>, he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“was necessary for
        the purpose for which they were summoned on this occasion, namely, to
        witness the ceremony of the consecration of Aaron and his sons to the
        priestly office”</span>. Now it is nowhere stated that this was, in
        point of fact, the purpose for which the people were gathered
        together. Certainly, if it were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">impossible</span></em> they could witness the
        ceremony, as Dr. Colenso assures us, we are bound to infer that it
        was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em> for this purpose they were
        assembled. Nor is it difficult to find another, and quite a
        sufficient reason, for gathering the people together on this solemn
        occasion. It may have been the design of God that, by their
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">presence</span></em> in and around the court of
        the tabernacle, they should make a public profession of their faith,
        and formally acknowledge the priesthood of Aaron. Thus, in the
        illustration already introduced, it was impossible for 100,000 people
        to hear O'Connell speak; but their presence was itself a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> public declaration that they adhered to
        his principles and accepted him for their leader.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was it, however,
        really impossible that those without the court should witness the
        leading features of the ceremony? Certainly not. We must bear in mind
        that the court was not enclosed by stone walls, but by hangings of
        fine linen. Nothing, therefore, could have been more simple than to
        loop up these curtains to the pillars by which they were supported,
        and thus to afford a full view of the tabernacle to those who stood
        without. Dr. Colenso will probably say that in the scripture
        narrative there is no mention of any such arrangement. Neither, we
        reply, is it said that those without the court were intended to
        witness the ceremony. But if we suppose that this was intended, we
        must also suppose that the means were adopted which would make it
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">possible</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is yet
        another error of Dr. Colenso which we cannot pass by in silence. It
        is true, the blunder to which we refer has little to do with his
        argument. But it has much to do with the question whether he is a
        competent authority on the sacred text, even when he speaks with
        special emphasis and with unhesitating confidence. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Supposing that <span class="tei tei-q">‘all the
        congregation’</span> of adult males ... had hastened to take their
        stand ... in front, not merely of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">door</span></em>, but
        of the whole <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">end</span></em> of the tabernacle in which the
        door was”</span>, etc. It is clear that the writer of this passage
        was under the impression (which, indeed, he conveys not only by his
        words, but still more by his italics—for they <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> his)
        that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        whole end</span></em> of the tabernacle was wider than the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">door</span></em>. Now
        if he had taken the pains to read even an English translation of the
        sacred book which he so rashly presumed to condemn, he never could
        have fallen into so great a mistake. He would have seen that the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole
        eastern end</span></em> of the tabernacle was left open, and that the
        open space was covered only by a curtain which extended across from
        side to side. Consequently, if mention were really made of a door, it
        must have been this curtain itself that was called by that name.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if Dr. Colenso
        had gone a little further, and had consulted any Hebrew lexicon, he
        would have discovered that the sacred writer does not speak of a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">door</span></em>, but rather of a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">doorway</span></em>.
        The tabernacle had in fact no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">door</span></em> properly so called. The word
        פתח (<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "he"><span style="font-style: italic">pethach</span></span>), which
        is used by the sacred writers when speaking of the tabernacle,
        signifies, as Gesenius explains it, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an
        opening</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">an entrance</span></em>. It means, therefore,
        the whole end of the tabernacle, which was left <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">open</span></em> to
        the court when the curtain was drawn. In Hebrew the idea of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
        door</span></em> is expressed by דלת (<span lang="he" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">deleth</span></span>). When treating of this
        word, Gesenius, having first explained its meaning, pointedly
        remarks: <span class="tei tei-q">“It differs from פתח, which denotes
        the doorway which the door closes”</span>. It is quite <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> certain, therefore, that the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">door</span></em> and
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole
        end of the tabernacle</span></em>, which Dr. Colenso so emphatically
        contrasts, were in reality one and the same thing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is time,
        however, that we pass to another of Dr. Colenso's arguments:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We agree with Dr.
        Colenso that this is a <span class="tei tei-q">“huge
        difficulty”</span>, and that the duties of the priest, as described
        by him, involve a manifest absurdity. But we contend that the duties
        of the priest, as described by him, are not to be found in the
        Pentateuch; that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all the circumstances</span></em> which
        constitute the difficulty and the absurdity are simply <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">additions of his
        own</span></em>. This is indeed a serious charge against a writer who
        represents himself to the public as an earnest and conscientious
        searcher after truth. But we hope to satisfy our readers that it is a
        plain and obvious fact; and it is our duty, as Dr. Colenso truly
        tells us, <span class="tei tei-q">“to look plain facts in the
        face”</span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is evident that
        the whole weight of the objection consists in this: that, according
        to the sacred narrative, the priest is commanded, first, to carry the
        bullock <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">himself</span></em>; secondly, to carry it
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on his
        back</span></em>; thirdly, in doing so, to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">go on
        foot</span></em>. Now there is not the faintest insinuation in any
        text Dr. Colenso has produced, nor, we may add, in any text the
        Pentateuch contains, that the priest should <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">go on
        foot</span></em>, or that he should carry the bullock <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on his
        back</span></em>. These two ideas are to be found only in the
        fanciful and rather irreverent gloss of Dr. Colenso.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Neither is it
        commanded in the sacred text that the priest should <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">himself</span></em>
        carry the bullock out of the camp. Even in the English translation
        there is nothing to imply that he might not, for this duty, employ
        the service of his attendant Levites. It is said, indeed,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“he shall carry forth the bullock without the
        camp”</span>. But by the common use of language we may impute to a
        person, as his own, the act which he does by the agency of another.
        Thus a minister of state is said to write a letter, when the letter
        is written at his direction by his secretary. In the Fourth Book of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Kings</span></span> it is recorded of
        Nabuchodonosor that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he carried away all
        Jerusalem</span></em>, and all the princes, and all the valiant men
        of the army, to the number of ten thousand, into captivity:... and
        the judges of the land he carried into captivity from Jerusalem into
        Babylon. And all the strong men, seven thousand, and the artificers
        and the smiths a thousand”</span>, etc.—(IV. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kings</span></span>,
        xxiv. 14-16). No one dreams of any difficulty in a sentence like
        this. Yet, if we admit the Colenso system of interpretation, the
        difficulty is insuperable, because the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">meaning of the
        sentence</span></em> is, that Nabuchodonosor <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">himself</span></em>
        carried that immense multitude <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">on his back</span></em> from Jerusalem to
        Babylon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we now turn to
        the Hebrew text we shall find that it is still less favourable to Dr.
        Colenso and his <span class="tei tei-q">“huge difficulty”</span>. The
        word והוציא (vehotzi), which is there used, literally means
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and he
        shall cause [it] to go forth</span></em>, that is to say, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he shall have it
        removed</span></em>. This will be at once admitted by every biblical
        scholar, and can be made intelligible without much difficulty to the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374"
        id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> general reader. In the Hebrew
        language there are several forms of the same verb, sometimes called

        primitive form is <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

        bow</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">to bend</span></em>. Now, in the passage quoted
        by Dr. Colenso the word והוציא is the <span lang="he" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hiphil</span></span> form of יצא (yatza),
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to go
        forth</span></em>; it therefore means literally <em class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> We need
        scarcely remark that the priest would comply with this injunction
        whether he himself in person removed the bullock, or whether he
        employed the Levites to do it; whether he carried it on his back,
        according to the ridiculous paraphrase of Dr. Colenso, or removed it
        in wagons provided for the purpose.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now that our
        paper approaches to a close, it may be asked what is the result of
        our labours, and what has been gained to the cause of truth by all
        the minute and tedious details through which we have conducted our
        readers? It seems to us that we have directly answered two of Dr.
        Colenso's arguments, and that we have moreover established indirectly
        a strong presumption against all the rest. Let us put a case to our
        readers. A jeweller exhibits for sale a string of pearls. He demands
        a very high price, but he pledges his word of honour that the pearls
        are of the rarest quality and of the highest excellence. A casual
        passer-by is attracted by the glittering gems. He enters the shop; he
        listens with eager credulity to the earnest protestations of the
        merchant; but he hesitates when the price is named. At this critical
        moment a friend arrives, who is happily somewhat versed in jewellery.
        He selects one or two pearls from the string, and after a brief
        inspection clearly shows, not merely that the price is far beyond
        their value, but that they are not pearls at all. What would be
        thought of the merchant who had offered them for sale? Who would
        frequent his shop? Who would believe <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the other pearls to be genuine on the strength
        of his protestations? It may be indeed that he is not a swindler; but
        if he is an honest man, he is certainly a very indifferent judge of
        his business.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now what this
        jeweller is in a matter of commerce, such, as it seems to us, has Dr.
        Colenso been proved to be in a matter of infinitely greater moment.
        He comes before the world with the prestige of a great name and of a
        high position. He earnestly announces that he has made a great
        discovery, and that he is forced by his conscience to speak out his
        mind. He offers to the public an attractive array of brilliant and
        plausible arguments; and in return he asks us to surrender the
        inestimable treasure of Christian faith. At first we are bewildered
        and perplexed by the novelty and variety of his arguments; but after
        a little we summon up courage; we select two or three from the
        number, and these we submit to a minute and careful analysis. We find
        that they are miserably defective and utterly inconclusive. Facts are
        misrepresented, the meaning of language is perverted, the principles
        of sound reasoning are disregarded. May we not then fairly infer that
        Dr. Colenso's earnest protestations of sincerity and good intention
        afford a very insufficient guarantee for the accuracy of his
        statements and the stability of his arguments? We do not say that he
        is dishonest; but we do say that he has proved himself a very
        incompetent authority.</p>

        the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        briefly referred to a Bishop of Cloyne and Cork who is venerated as
        blessed, in Ivrea, a town of Piedmont. In conformity with the few
        fragments preserved in the archives of Ivrea and elsewhere regarding
        him, we adopted the opinion that his name, according to modern
        orthography, should be rendered Thaddeus Maher. Since the publication
        of the article just mentioned, a paper containing much valuable
        matter has been communicated to us through the great kindness of the
        Very Rev. Dr. M'Carthy, the learned Professor of Scripture in

        he could have had any knowledge of our views on this subject. We are
        anxious to publish every document that we can find on this
        interesting question, in the hope that by discussing it, light may be
        thrown on the history of a holy Irish bishop, who is honoured beyond
        the Alps, but so little known at home, that there is great difficulty
        in determining his real name. In one of our next numbers we shall

        1847, the Most Rev. Dr. Murray, Archbishop of Dublin, received at
        Maynooth a letter covering a bill of exchange for £40 (1,000 francs),
        sent for the relief of the famine-stricken poor of Ireland, by order
        of the good Bishop of Ivrea. The town of Ivrea (anciently

        precludes a literal translation of this paper, a summary may be
        acceptable to the reader.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 24th of
        October, 1492, died at Ivrea, in St. Antony's Hospice for Pilgrims,
        Blessed Thaddeus, an Irish bishop, whose body was deposited under the
        high altar of the cathedral, in a shrine over the relics of the holy
        patron, St. Eusebius. At the time of death a brilliant light was seen
        round his bed, and at the same moment to the Bishop of Ivrea there
        appeared a man of venerable mien, clothed in pontifical robes.
        Several other miracles were also wrought through his intercession.
        The papers found with him showed he was an Irish bishop, and these,
        as well as other documents proving his great sanctity, religiously
        kept in the episcopal archives, were destroyed by fire in the
        seventeenth century. In an old parchment, written in Gothic letters,
        still preserved in the archives of the cathedral church, are these
        lines:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Dr. Murray
        received the Bishop of Ivrea's letter, he placed it in the hands of
        the late venerated President of Maynooth College, from whose MSS. it
        is now copied, together with the very literal translation of the
        verses made by one of the junior students at the time. Dr. Renehan
        undertook to collect all the notices of Blessed Thaddeus in our Irish
        annals, and to give the best answers he could to the bishop's
        questions. He even visited Ivrea in the summer of 1850, in the hope
        of finding traditional records of the life of Blessed Thaddeus, but
        to no purpose. He found the task more difficult than might be
        expected. All the knowledge regarding the saint's family, see, etc.,
        that can be gathered from Irish or British sources is found in these
        few lines from Ware on the Bishops of Cloyne:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Thady M'Carthy</span></span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">succ.</span></span>
        1490).—Upon the resignation of William, Thady M'Carthy, by some
        called Mechar, succeeded the same year by a provision from Pope
        Innocent VIII., as may be seen from the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Collectanea</span></span> of Francis
        Harold”</span>—Ware's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Bishops</span></span> (Harris), p. 563.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Blessed
        Thaddeus's name is unhonoured then, in his own country; his
        biography, if ever written, is at least not recorded by the Irish
        historians. Even the scanty information which the industrious Ware
        supplies, was gleaned not from our annals, but from Harold's
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Collectanea</span></span>, probably notes and
        extracts taken from documents in the continental libraries. Dr.
        Renehan had, therefore, little to add on our saint's life. He was,
        however, fully satisfied that Blessed Thaddeus of Ivrea was no other
        than the Bishop of Cork and Cloyne, mentioned by Ware. His arguments
        may be seen in a rough outline of his answer to the Bishop of Ivrea's
        letter, among the O'Renehan MSS. in Maynooth, almost the only
        authority we had time to consult for this notice. Sometimes the very
        words of the letter are given in inverted commas:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I. The Pilgrim of
        Ivrea was an Irish bishop who died in the year 1492. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The most diligent search through our Irish annals will
        not discover another bishop to whom even so much of the poet's
        description will apply but Thaddeus M'Carthy, Bishop of Cloyne. About
        that date there were indeed in Ireland five bishops named Thaddeus:
        1. Thady, Bishop of Kilmore, since <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> before 1460; but his successor Furseus died in
        1464, and Thomas, the third from him, died before 1492. 2. Thady
        M'Cragh, of Killaloe, succeeded in 1430, full sixty years before our
        saint's death at Ivrea. His third successor died in 1460. 3. Thady,
        Bishop of Down, was consecrated in Rome, 1469, died in 1486, and his
        successor, R. Wolsey, was named before 1492. 4. Thady of Ross died
        soon after his appointment in 1488, succeeded by Odo in 1489. 5.
        Thady of Dromore, appointed only in 1511, and the see was held by
        George Brown in 1492. The date (1492) is alone enough to prove that
        B. Thaddeus of Ivrea was not any of the preceding bishops, and there
        was no other of the name for full sixty years after or before, but
        the Bishop of Cork and Cloyne, the date of whose death fits exactly
        all the requirements of the case. Ware quotes from Harold that he was
        appointed by Innocent VIII. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sed.</span></span> 1484-1492,) that he succeeded
        W. Roch, resigned 1490, and further, that Gerald, who succeeded,
        resigned in 1499, after obtaining a pardon from Henry VII. in
        1496”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Lib. Mun.</span></span>, i. p. 102)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">II. Another line
        of the old fragment seems to name the see of the B. Thaddeus, whom
        the poet describes as lamenting his death abroad, far from the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“solum Chariense”</span>, or <span class=

        by Irish writers, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cloynensis”</span>,

        natural than that a poet would describe the pilgrim as longing to be
        buried either in his cathedral church of <em class=

        with his fathers in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">III. The passage
        which seems to us most decisive, is that which points to the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">royal

        Bishop M'Carthy was called also <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Mechar”</span>. Clearly both were one and the same name.
        Thus [Gaelic: Mac Careaw], Anglicised M'Carthy, is pronounced
        Maccaura, with the last syllable short, as in Ard-Magha (Armagh), and
        numberless like words. Hence Wadding,<a id="noteref_8" name=
        "noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> in
        speaking of the foundation of Muckross Abbey, Killarney, by Domnal
        M'Carthy, Prince of Desmond, quotes to this effect a Bull of Paul
        II., in 1468, in which Domnall's name is spelled <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Machar</span></em>”</span>, a form identical
        with that in the contemporary fragment. In truth, there is no Irish
        family name like <span class="tei tei-q">“Machar”</span> at all but
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Meagher”</span>, which is invariably spelled
        with <span class="tei tei-q">“O”</span>, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“O'Meaghers”</span> had no claim to
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">royal</span></em> blood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">IV. The Blessed
        Thaddeus was <span class="tei tei-q">“regia progenies”</span>. Now
        there was no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        that in the inscription except the truly <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">royal</span></em>
        name, made more royal still by the saintly Bishop of Cloyne. Without
        insisting with Keating that the ancestry of the M'Carthy family could
        be traced through twenty-eight monarchs who governed the island
        before the Christian era, we may assert with the Abbe MacGeoghan, in
        a note (tom. iii. p. 680), strangely omitted by his translator,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that if regard be had to primogeniture and
        seniority of descent, the M'Carthy family is the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> in
        Ireland”</span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Long before the
        founders of the oldest royal families in Europe—before Rodolph
        acquired the empire of Germany, or a Bourbon ascended the throne of
        France—the saintly Cormac M'Carthy, the disciple, the friend, and
        patron of St. Malachy, ruled over Munster, and the title of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">king</span></em> was at least continued in name
        in his posterity down to the reign of Elizabeth. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Few pedigrees, if any”</span>, says Sir B. Burke,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“in the British empire can be traced to a
        more remote or exalted source than that of the Celtic house of
        M'Carthy.... They command a prominent, perhaps the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">most
        prominent</span></em> place in European genealogy”</span>. Plain then
        is it that in no other house could the <span class="tei tei-q">“regia
        progenies”</span> be verified more fully than in the M'Carthy
        family.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">V. The date of
        death, the wished-for burial place, his native soil (Kerry), or his
        diocese (Cloyne)—the name and royal extraction, all point to the
        Bishop of Cloyne as the saint whose relics are still worshipped at
        Ivrea. If we add that <span class="tei tei-q">“Chiar”</span> is the
        usual Irish form of Kerry; that Domnall's (the founder of Irrelagh)
        father's name was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        Saint's uncle, the evidence seems to be overwhelming.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">VI. We have said
        there is no account in Irish writers of even the Bishop of Cloyne,
        except the few lines in Ware. The continental annalists of the
        religious orders do, however, speak of one celebrated Thaddeus,
        without mentioning his surname or country. Elsius (quoting
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
        Herera</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Crusen</span></span>, whose works are not within
        our reach) notices Thaddeus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">de Hipporegio</span></em> sive <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Iporegia</span></em>,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“as a man distinguished for learning,
        religious observance, preaching, holiness of life, and experience, a
        man of great zeal, and a sedulous promoter of the interests of his
        order”</span>. He was prior, he adds, of several convents, seven
        times definitor, thirteen times visitator, four times president of
        synods, nine times vicar-general, and his government was ever
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381"
        id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> distinguished for the greatest
        love of order and edifying example. See Els., <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Encom.</span></span>,
        August., p. 645.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After quoting
        these words in substance from the Augustinian chronicler, Dr. Renehan
        adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“After the most diligent inquiry I
        could make at Ivrea, wherever I could hope for any little
        information, particularly at the episcopal palace (where I was
        received with marked respect, as a priest from the country that sent
        out the B. Thaddeus), and of the Bishop's secretary, the
        vicar-general, and many others, whose kind attention I can never
        forget, I could find no vestige of any other Thaddeus, called after
        the city (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Eporedia</span></span>), but our own blessed
        Irish bishop; and I was assured, over and over again, that he was the
        only Thaddeus known in its annals, or who ever had any connection
        with the town, by birth, residence, death—or any way known to the
        present generation”</span>. It is not then unreasonable to suppose
        that the Thaddeus so celebrated in the Augustinian Order was no other
        than our Bishop. True, Elsius gives 1502 for the date of the friar's
        demise; but Elsius is never to be trusted in dates, and the printer
        may easily take MCCCCXCII. (the true date), for MCCCCCII. Indeed,
        1492 is not so different from 1502 that an error may not have crept
        in.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. Renehan's
        theory, then, with regard to B. Thaddeus, fully detailed in the
        letter to the Bishop of Ivrea, was this:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thaddeus M'Carthy
        was born in Kerry, where the M'Carthy More branch of the family
        resided, and where, in the monastery of Irialac (now Muckross), or in
        Ennisfallen (see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Archdall</span></span>), the princes of the
        house were always buried. The young Thaddeus went abroad at an early
        age, and embraced the monastic life. His virtues and piety soon
        attracted the notice of his religious brethren, as manifest from
        their chronicles. They became in time known to the ruling Pontiff,
        Innocent VIII., who raised him to the episcopal dignity. The B.
        Thaddeus repaired to Rome in the first place, to receive consecration
        and jurisdiction from the successor of St. Peter, imitating in this
        the example of our great patron saint. He stopped at Ivrea, probably
        on his way home, fell sick there, and died, God witnessing to His
        servant by signs and wonders. The silence of our annalists is thus
        accounted for to a great extent by the long residence of B. Thaddeus
        abroad. This theory is remarkably borne out by the independent notice
        in last <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Record</span></span>. Having little to help us
        to arrive at any correct notion of the saintly bishop's life beyond
        the epitaph and the slender tradition at Ivrea, we entirely subscribe
        to this view. Other sources of information may be opened, now that we
        have ventured to bring, for the first time, the name of B. Thaddeus
        before the Irish Catholic people; and for this service, little as it
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382"
        id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is, and entirely unworthy of
        our saintly bishop, we still expect his blessing in full measure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From these decrees
        the following conclusions may clearly be established:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. On all Sundays
        and holidays of obligation, and feasts of first and second class, the
        Mass of the day is to be said with the commemoration of the Mass pro
        sponso et sponsa. This appears clear from the decree 4266 quoted
        above.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. This
        commemoration is to be made sub altera conclusione, and not sub unica
        conclusione cum oratione Festi.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. If there are
        other commemorations to be made in the Mass of the day, they are to
        be said before the commemoration of the Mass pro sponso et sponsa.
        This appears from the answer given <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> by the Sacred Congregation of Rites to the
        question 8 in the Decree No. 4437, and Gardellini, in a note on this
        same question, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Imo si occurrant plures
        commemorationes ut accidit potissimum dum celebranda est Missa de
        Dominica, illa Nuptiarum primum dumtaxat locum obtinere poterit post
        alias a rubrica praeceptas et sic reliquas praestare, siquae sint a
        superiore imperatae”</span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. The decree 4394
        makes it clear that on all the ordinary doubles throughout the year,
        the Missa pro sponso et sponsa may be celebrated; and it declares,
        moreover, that it is a votive private Mass, and, as such, to be said
        sine Gloria et Credo, with the second and third prayers of the day
        occurring, and to conclude with the Benedicamus Domino and the Gospel
        of St. John. This decree, clear as it may appear, gave rise to
        another question about privileged octaves which exclude doubles,
        which was afterwards proposed to the Sacred Congregation of Rites,
        and to which an answer was given on the 20th April, 1822, in the
        Decree 4437, already quoted, question 5.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gardellini, in a
        valuable note, explains the matter fully, and we quote his words on
        the subject:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hisce decretis compositae quaestiones omnes videbantur:
        secus tamen accidit, nam nova excitata sunt dubia. Quippe nonnulli
        sunt, qui opinantur Missam hanc dici posse etiam diebus qui excludunt
        duplicia per annum, praesertim vero infra octavam Epiphaniae, in
        vigilia Pentecostes et infra octavam privilegiatam sanctissimi
        Corporis Christi. In hac autem opinione versantur quia in primo illo
        Decreto dies isti expressim et nominatim non excipiuntur. Ast hi
        errant quam maxime. Non enim declaratione indigebat id, quod sub
        generali prohibitione, utpote a Rubricis jam vetitum continebatur.
        Jubet Decretum, ne Missa nuptiarum celebretur in duplicibus primae
        vel secundae classis sed vult ut in hujusmodi occursu solam obtineant
        commemorationem: ergo includit in regula etiam dies, in quibus per
        easdem Rubricas fieri nequit Festum duplex secundae classis vel
        occurrens vel translatum si in octava Epiphaniae duplicia isthaec non
        admittuntur, potiori jure nec Missa votiva privata non obstante
        Indultu admitti poterit, utpote quae in occursu hujusmodi duplicium
        celebranda non est”</span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must refer our
        readers to this very instructive note of Gardellini, which we regret
        we cannot insert here in full, owing to its great length. Indeed it
        is not necessary to do so, inasmuch as the answer given to the
        question 5 in the Decree 4437, already quoted, puts an end to further
        discussion, and settles the question definitively.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are other

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the March
          number of your valuable periodical there was a most interesting
          paper on the See of Down and Connor. I apprehend, however, it
          contained a few slight mistakes, which I would have pointed out,
          but hoped that some person more intimately conversant with the

          been the case, I shall endeavour to do so. However, before entering
          on these matters, I beg to say, in illustration of your learned
          contributor's notes, that the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=

          Carrickfergus, in the county of Antrim (see Reeves, p. 52); that
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Lesmoghan</span></span>, of which Bishop
          Killen had been pastor, still bears the same name, forming a
          sub-denomination of the parish of Ballykinler, county Down (Ib., p.
          28); that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Baliconingham</span></span> (now Coniamstown,
          near Downpatrick) was rector, is now the mensal parish of Ardquin,
          in the barony of Ardes, county Down (Ib., p. 20); and that
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Camelyn</span></span>, of which Bishop Dongan
          was pastor, is now called Crumlin, being united to the parish of

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span>, p.
          4). Returning from this digression, it is quite plain from the Bull
          dated June, 1461, given by De Burgo (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hib.
          Dom.</span></span>, p. 474), and cited by your contributor, p. 267,
          appointing Richard Wolsey to the See of Down, that Wolsey was not
          the immediate successor of Bishop John, who died in 1450. It
          expressly states, as mentioned in the article, that the See was
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vacant</span></em> by the death of

          "font-variant: small-caps">Thomas</span></span>, last bishop of the
          canonically united dioceses of Down and Connor, repeating the same
          name in the body of the Bull. How this is to be reconciled with the
          statement that Wolsey was John's successor, I cannot say; but it
          follows, on the principle laid down by your contributor in ignoring
          John Logan, placed by Ware between William, bishop from 1365 to
          1368, and Richard Calf II., 1369, that we must have a Bishop Thomas
          between John and Richard Wolsey. Dr. Reeves (<span class=

          Down</span></span>, etc., p. 257), on the authority of this very
          Bull, has accordingly done so, marking him as succeeding in 1450,

          Pollard</span></span>, who in 1450 was appointed custose of the
          temporalities. Dr. Cotton (vol. iii. p. 201) adopts this view
          without hesitation, and it would appear by a complaint of the
          beforementioned Bishop John, shortly after the union of Down and
          Connor in 1441, that even then Pollard claimed to have an
          apostolical provision for the See of Down (Primate Mey's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Registry</span></span>, cited by Reeves, p.
          37; see also Harris's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ware</span></span>, p. 203, where it is
          likewise mentioned that Pollard contested the See of Down with John
          of Connor, both carrying themselves as bishops thereof, Harris
          adding that it was thought Pollard was supported by the primate,
          and that it was only in 1449 Pollard lost his cause, just two years
          before Wolsey's appointment). It may be asked, had he a
          reversionary provision before the union was canonically effected?
          If not, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Thomas</span></em> a misprint for <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></em> in
          the Bull? as we are aware that there are many typographical errors
          in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next bishop
          respecting whom I wish to make some observations is Eugene or Owen
          Magenis, appointed in 1541, and though I am not disposed to deal
          uncharitably with him, I have no doubt he was a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“temporiser”</span>, though he may have been secretly
          <span class="tei tei-q">“orthodox”</span>. Dr. M'Carthy (Dr.
          Kelly's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essays</span></span>, p. 427), and Brennan,
          and Walsh, in their ecclesiastical histories of Ireland are
          compelled to come to the same conclusion; and upon the whole of his
          career I candidly confess I don't know what other result they could
          arrive at. I ground nothing on his being present, if he were
          present, at Queen Elizabeth's first parliament in 1560, which
          passed the Act of Uniformity, and required the oath of supremacy to
          be taken by all ecclesiastics; for even if he had been present,
          there is no documentary evidence extant showing how those in
          attendance voted, and those acquainted with Irish history know on
          the authority of Archdeacon Lynch that these acts were hurriedly
          and surreptitiously passed on a day when they were not expected to
          be brought forward, and in a thin packed house. But it appears, so
          far as his public acts are reported, that he submitted in matters
          of ecclesiastical discipline to all the rapid changes and schisms
          which the fertile imaginations of the pseudo-reformers introduced
          during the Tudor reigns. He surrendered his bulls to Henry VIII.,
          obtained from Paul, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bishop of
          Rome”</span>, not <span class="tei tei-q">“His Holiness”</span>;
          took out pardon for accepting them, with a new grant of the see,
          with the archdeaconry and confirmation of the parishes of Aghaderg
          and Anaghlone, parishes to which <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he had
          been</span></em> promoted by the Primate in 1526 and 1528. It is an
          oversight to suppose that about 1541 and 1543 the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> northern chieftains who submitted to
          Henry VIII. were exempted from all pressure in matter of religion.
          Cox (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aug.
          Hib.</span></span>, vol. i. p. 272) writes that the king about that
          time caused all the Irish who submitted to him to renounce the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Pope's usurpations, and to own the king's
          supremacy by indenture”</span>, among others, stating that O'Neill
          did so, January, 1542, all the indentures being registered in the
          Red Book of the Exchequer. The articles of Con O'Neill's submission
          are printed in vol. iii. part iii. p. 353, of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">State Papers of Henry
          VIII</span></span>.; and by the second article, he expressly
          renounces obedience to the Roman Pontiff and his usurped authority,
          and acknowledges the king to be the supreme head of the Church in
          England and Ireland, immediately under Christ. Manus O'Donnell, 3rd
          June the preceding year, in his letter styles the king on Earth
          immediately under Christ supreme head of the Church of
          England—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span>, p. 217). M'Donell, captain
          of the galloglasses, goes further, and promises to annihilate and
          relinquish the usurped authority of the Bishop of Rome; and his
          adherents and abettors will expel, extirp, and diminish,
          etc.—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span>, p. 383). Redmond MacMahon,
          captain of the Farney, 30th December, 1543, also renounces the
          usurped authority of the Roman Pontiff—(Shirley's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Farney</span></span>,
          p. 40). Even in the reign of Queen Mary, we find Owen Macgenis, of
          Iveagh, chief of his sept and captain of his country, binding
          himself not to admit any provisions from Rome, but oppose them all
          he could—(Cox, i. p. 299). No doubt these indentures were extorted
          by necessity from these chiefs, who scoffed at the idea that Henry
          had any religion or was the head of any church, and kept the
          articles just as long as they could not help it. Dr. M'Carthy, I
          presume on the ground of Bishop Magenis suing out pardon in Queen
          Mary's reign, considers he afterwards <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“repented”</span>, being made a privy councillor and
          governor of his country; but then we have two similar acts of
          repentance in Elizabeth's reign, for he took out the royal pardon,
          1st May and 25th October in her first year, thus atoning for his
          folly in her predecessor's. If he lived till 1564, as Dr. Moran
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Archbishops of Dublin</span></span>)
          supposes—though I consider he was dead in 1563, from the queen's
          letter, dated 6th January, 1564, naming James M'Caghwell to the
          see, then <span class="tei tei-q">“destitute of an
          incumbent”</span>, and also from the fact of Shane O'Neill applying
          for the see for his brother, 1563-4—then, knowing that the greater
          parts of the counties of Down and Antrim were, in the early years
          of Elizabeth's reign, completely under subjection to the English,
          and coupling this with the solicitation of the royal pardons, the
          least that can be said is, that Bishop Magenis acquiesced in or
          tacitly submitted to the ecclesiastical changes enacted in the
          parliament of 1560, not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg
          388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          forgetting that about the same time Andrew Brereton, governor of
          Lecale (called Britton by Anthony Bruodin, in Dr. Moran's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Archbishops of Dublin</span></span>, p. 142),
          mercilessly strangled John O'Lochran and two other Franciscan
          friars, in Downpatrick. But I have reserved for the last the
          conduct of Bishop Magenis in the reign of Edward VI. On the 2nd of
          February, 1552-3, he assisted George Brown of Dublin in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">consecrating</span></em> Hugh Goodacre to be
          Archbishop of Armagh, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">John Bale</span></em> to be Bishop of Ossory,
          according to a new-fangled form annexed to the second Book of
          Common Prayer of Edward VI., which was not even authorised by act
          of parliament, nor by any order of the king (Mant, vol. i. p.
          219)—as an Erastian church would require—which was opposed by the
          Catholic clergy at the time, and afterwards, in the reign of Queen
          Mary, condemned by all the Catholic bishops of England as invalid,
          defective in matter, form, and intention. And who was this John
          Bale whom Bishop Magenis assisted in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">consecrating</span></em> by this vitiated
          rite? He, according to Pits, as quoted by Harris (Ware's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Bishops</span></span>, p. 417), was
          <span class="tei tei-q">“an English Heretick, an apostate
          Carmelite, and a married priest. This poor wretch, except his
          calumnies against men and his blasphemies against God and his
          saints, hath nothing in him worthy to be taken notice of”</span>.
          Condemned by his brother Protestants, Vossius, Wharton, etc., for
          his acrimony and falsehood, it is little wonder the Catholics, on
          the death of Edward VI., chased him from Kilkenny. Had his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“King Johan: a play, in two parts”</span>,
          published by the Camden Society in 1838, been known in his
          lifetime, in which drama he apotheosises that merciless tyrant,
          alike despicable, cruel, and infamous, the murderer of his own
          nephew, as a great reformer, <span class="tei tei-q">“the model of
          every virtue, human and divine”</span>, it would have completed his
          infamy and disgrace. No earthly fears should have prevailed on an
          orthodox bishop to pretend to consecrate a man whose life was such
          a disgrace to religion. I do not lay much stress on the formal
          words of the Bull appointing Myler Magrath to these sees, 12th
          October, 1565, vacant <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per obitum Eugenii
          Magnissae</span></span>: it simply shows he was not deposed, and it
          may have been with him as with his successor, that hopes were
          entertained for some years that he would abandon his state
          conformity, which I trust was the case. The astute and wily
          ministers of Elizabeth at this early date did not compel apostacy,
          nor seek for purity of morals; though apostates themselves, all
          they required was outward conformity, that the elect should take
          investiture from the crown. They bided their time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
          questionable but that Sir James Ware knew Bishop Dougan had been
          Bishop of Soder and Man, for in one of his MSS. in Trinity College
          Library, cited by Reeves, p. 177, he <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class=

          1373, <span class="tei tei-q">“Factus Episcopus Sodorensis sive
          Insular. Manniar, 1374”</span>; the different spelling of the name,
          and the great age Dr. Dougan must have attained before his
          elevation to Down in 1394 (living till 1412), may have induced him
          to doubt the identity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am delighted
          to learn that we are to have these valuable papers with others on
          the succession of the Irish sees, published in a separate volume;
          and were I permitted to offer a suggestion, I would recommend that
          the succession should be brought down to the period of the
          Confederation of Kilkenny, when all the sees, with the exception of
          Derry and Dromore, were, I think, full. Enriched with a few
          biographical notes, such a work would be a valuable accession to
          Irish ecclesiastical history, and would, besides, utterly shatter
          the vain and fanciful theories of Mant, Palmer, etc., as to
          apostolical succession through the puritanical Adam Loftus, the
          apostate rector of Outwell, in Norfolk, to which he had been
          appointed in 1556—(Cotton's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          the paper on Cork and Cloyne in your last number to be a native of
          Munster; whereas Myler Magrath was eldest son of Donogh, otherwise
          Gillagmagna Magrath, of Termon Magrath, county of Fermanagh, of
          which the family had been erenachs. He married Anne O'Meara, by

          the relationship? I don't understand why Myler is named as the
          foster-brother of the great Shane O'Neill. The latter was fostered
          by the O'Donnellys of Tyrone, and hence frequently styled Shane
          Donnellagh. Terence Donnelly, alias Daniel, Dean of Armagh, was his

          in the casual mistakes he made; and all the casuistical works
          recently published have inserted in their pages those mistakes.
          Take, for example, the works on moral theology most in circulation
          at present, such as the works of Gousset, Gury, Scavini, and it
          will be found that in the very latest editions of these works those
          errors are left untouched.</p>

          will appear from the remarks of Card. Gousset, t. 2, n. 1136, that
          he adheres to the opinion of St. Liguori.</p>

          the petition for which only one vinculum was expressed, whereas
          there existed two—duplex vinculum.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I believe St.
          Liguori was led into the mistake either by confounding the word

          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "font-style: italic">de tertio</span></em> gradu propinquiore,
          etc., of which there was question.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gury's opinion
          also is wrong; for it is certain, from the decree of St. Pius V.,
          as cited and confirmed by Benedict XIV., that the suppression of
          the mention of the first grade in the petition for dispensation in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gradu
          inaequali consang. off.</span></em>, will equally annul the
          dispensation, whether the first grade concur with the second,
          third, or fourth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order then
          that St. Liguori's opinion be correct, it is necessary to erase the

            cod. Provincia Armacana radunata in Drogheda il di 8. e 9. Agosto
            dell'anno scorso; questa S. Cong. di Propaganda dopo un lungo
            esame hà finalmente coll'oracolo di Nostro Sig. PP. Pio VI.
            pronunziato il suo guidizio sù le medesime e ne communica
            specialmente a V S. come amministratore di cod. Metropolitana le
            sue determinazoni, perchè le faccia ben tosto partecipi ai
            Prelati sudetti. Si è in primo luogo pertanto riconosciuto, che a
            quest'assemblea non può darsi il nome di Sinodo Provinciale,
            essendo essa mancante di tutte quelle solennità, e forme che ai
            sinodi convengono, e specialmente dell'intervento del Capitolo
            della Chiesa Metropolitana, che dee sempre ai sinodi invitarsi,

            del Capitolo derogato. Mà quantunque non si possa dare a
            quest'adunanza de' Vescovi il carattere, e il vigore di sinodo

            della Sede Apostolica, poichè per i Decreti eziandio de' sinodi

            chiede sempre, e si preserva l'approvazione della S. Sede prima
            di esiggerne l'esservanza. L'esempio solo di S. Carlo Borromeo in
            tutti i sei Sinodi Provinciali di Milano può dar norma ai Vescovi
            come debbano regolarsi sù questo punto.</span></p>

            "font-size: 90%">E incominciando dalla terza risoluzione emanata
            dai Vescovi sudetti questa è sembrata assai ambigua, ed oscura.
            La dispensa de' proclami per celebrare un matrimonio secreto può
            concedersi cosi dall'Ordinario dell'uomo, che della donna, e si
            concede di fatti da quello, nella di cui Diocesi si contrae il
            matrimonio, siasi Ordinario dell'uno, o dell'altro de contraenti.
            Se dunque si è preteso di limitare questa facoltà al solo
            Ordinario dell'uomo, privandone l'Ordinario della donna, questa
            risoluzione non dee osservarsi, poichè è contraria ad ogni
            ragione canonica, e all'osservanza. Se poi si è voluto soitanto
            intendere, che dopo essersi ottenuto questa dispensa
            dall'Ordinario dell'uomo, non faccia d'uopo di riportarla ancora
            da quello della donna allora la risoluzione potrà eseguirsi, e
            non merita riprensione.</span></p>

            debbe essere per ogni conto proscritta. Si è risoluto, che ogni
            dispensa dai gradi proibiti di parentela sia concessa
            dall'Ordinario di ciascuna parte contraente. Dovevano pur i
            Vescovi riflettere, che essendo la parentela un vincolo, che lega
            due persone, e impedisce, che trà loro si possa contrarre</span>

            da questo vincolo, ne viene in conseguenza, che ne sia prosciolta
            anche l'altra, non potendo restarne avvinta una, e libera
            l'altra. Se dunque per autorità legittima, o della Sede
            Apostolica, o di uno degli Ordinarj è tolto il vincolo di
            parentela trà un uomo, e una Donna, non vi è più bisogno di altra
            dispensa, ne fà, mestieri ricorrere all'altro Ordinario per
            ottenerla. . . . . . . Prego il Signore che La conservi e

            resolutions adopted at a meeting of the Suffragan Bishops of the
            Province of Armagh, held last year at Drogheda, on the 8th and
            9th of August, this S. Congregation of Propaganda, by authority
            of our Lord Pope Pius VI., after a protracted examination, has
            finally given judgment thereupon. This judgment it now signifies
            to your lordship, as Administrator of that Metropolitan See, in
            order that you may speedily communicate to the above-mentioned
            Prelates the decision which it has been led to take. First of
            all, however, it has been established that the meeting cannot be
            called a provincial synod, seeing that it wanted all the
            formalities prescribed for the holding of synods, and especially
            the presence of the Metropolitan Chapter, which, when immemorial
            usage to the contrary has not interfered with its right, ought
            always to be invited to synods. But although this meeting of
            bishops may not claim the character or the authority of a
            provincial synod, nevertheless its resolutions could not be
            published without the consent and approbation of the Apostolic
            See, since the decrees even of provincial synods, lawfully
            convened and celebrated in canonical form, require at all times
            the approbation of the Holy See before their observance can be
            made obligatory. The example of St. Charles Borromeo in the Six
            Provincial Synods of Milan, is of itself a sufficient guide for
            Bishops in this matter.</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style=
            "font-size: 90%">In the first place, then, the third resolution
            passed by the above-mentioned Bishops appears very ambiguous and
            obscure. In case of a private marriage, both the Ordinary of the
            man and the Ordinary of the woman have power to dispense with the
            publication of the banns, and as a matter of fact this
            dispensation is granted by the Bishop in whose diocese the
            marriage is celebrated, whether he be the Ordinary of the one or
            of the other of the contracting parties. If, then, the sense of
            the resolution be to limit this power to the Ordinary of the man,
            to the exclusion of the Ordinary of the woman, the resolution
            ought not to be carried out, as being contrary to the
            canons</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg
            393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">and to custom.
            But if, on the other hand, the meaning be, that when once the
            dispensation has been obtained from the Ordinary of the man,
            there is no need to obtain it also from the Ordinary of the
            woman, the resolution thus interpreted may be put into practice,
            and is not deserving of censure.</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style=
            "font-size: 90%">The fourth resolution, however, cannot be
            softened by any interpretation. That resolution prescribed that
            every dispensation in prohibited degrees of relationship should
            be granted by the Ordinary of each of the contracting parties.
            And yet the Bishops ought to have reflected that relationship
            being a bond which affects two persons, and prevents them from
            contracting matrimony one with the other, the moment one of these
            persons becomes free from this bond, the other, by a necessary
            consequence, is also set at liberty, it being impossible that one
            can be free whilst the other remains bound. Whenever, therefore,
            the bond of relationship between a man and a woman has been
            removed by lawful authority, either of the Holy See or of one of
            the Ordinaries, no second dispensation is required, nor is it
            necessary to have recourse to the other Ordinary to obtain such
            dispensation....</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This book has
          been compiled by authority, to serve as an appendix to the Roman
          Ritual, and is intended for the convenience of priests on the
          mission. In Ireland especially, where the Catholic instincts of the
          people have ever maintained pious confraternities in the honour
          which is their due, the clergy must have felt the want of a manual
          containing the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">formulæ</span></span> to be used in enrolling
          the faithful in the various religious societies approved by the
          Holy See. These forms are not to be found in the Roman Ritual, nor
          in the books easily accessible to the great body of priests.
          Besides, since every creature of God may be blessed by prayer, the
          Catholic Church, whilst she refuses to be reconciled with whatever
          is defective in modern progress, hastens, on the other hand, to
          sanctify by her blessing whatever this progress contains of good.
          Hence, new forms of prayer are rendered necessary from time to
          time, such as the form for blessing railways, and the Benedictio
          ad. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Omnia</span></span>, to be used in
          blessing all objects for which a special benediction is not
          contained in the Roman Ritual. These forms are to be found in this
          appendix. The instructions which the Holy See issues from time to
          time on various subjects for the guidance of missionary priests,
          also find their place in this collection. Among them is the
          Instructio, issued by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, for those
          who have permission to say two Masses on the same day in different
          churches, and which is inserted in the Ordo for use of the Irish
          clergy. To this is added, in the book under notice, the ritus
          servandus a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          be reduced to three heads. The first regards the sacraments, and
          embraces a short form for blessing the baptismal font; the rite of
          confirmation when administered by a simple priest by delegation
          from the Apostolic See; instruction for priests who duplicate;
          manner of carrying the Eucharist in secret to the sick among
          unbelievers; decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites concerning
          the oil for the lamp of the Blessed Sacrament. The second contains
          various forms of blessing, twenty-two in number, and including
          those for erecting the Via Crucis, and for enrolling in the
          scapulars of the different orders. The third part contains the
          ceremonies appointed by Benedict XIII. to be performed in the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are delighted
          to welcome this little work, both for the sake of its own proper
          merits, and because it is the first instalment of the authorized
          translation of the admirable works of Mgr. de Segur. The Encyclical
          and Syllabus still continue to be the great event of the day.
          Indeed, as yet, we see only the beginnings of the influence it is
          surely destined to exercise on men's minds; and for the due
          development of that influence, works like this of the French
          prelate are very necessary. The docile Catholic, for whom St. Peter
          lives and speaks in Pius IX., will find set forth herein the
          majesty and beauty of the doctrine he had before received in simple
          faith. The Catholic whose mind has been coloured for good and evil
          by modern ideas, and who has felt alarm at the apparent
          contradiction between the teaching of the Pope and certain social
          doctrines he has long held to be as sacred as first principles,
          will find in these pages wherewith to calm his apprehensions and
          steady his judgment <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg

          He will see that what the Church condemns is already condemned by
          reason and history; and that, far from placing under the ban any of
          the elements of true progress, the Holy See censures the very
          errors which make all true progress impossible. The priest who has
          charge of the wise and the unwise together, will be glad to have,
          in these few pages, what may enable him to provide for the wants of
          both. We quote a few passages:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even in the days
          of St. Augustine, Catholic eyes had to behold scenes somewhat
          similar to the one in view of which this pamphlet has been written.
          Within churches once Catholic, Donatist bishops at that time held
          high festival, in the midst of solemn pomp, with mystic rite and
          sacred song. From episcopal chairs erected in opposition to those
          of the prelates in communion with the Roman Pontiff, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">that is to say</span></em>”</span>, explains
          St. Cyprian, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with the Catholic
          Church</span></em>”</span>, intruded bishops counterfeited the
          preaching of the lawful pastors, and with many a text from Holy
          Writ, and with a plentiful use of holiest names, made a brave show
          of belonging to those whom the Holy Ghost has placed to rule the
          Church of God. But the make-believe was not successful. One glance
          at the religious system of these men and at the Catholic Church was
          enough to reveal the hollowness of their pretensions,
          notwithstanding the ecclesiastical air they so studiously
          cultivated. Hence St. Augustine thus writes about Emeritus, a
          Donatist bishop (for whom, perhaps, some worthy layman, not averse
          from proselytizing poor Catholics in the wild Numidian country
          about Cethaquenfusca, had restored one of the old cathedrals),
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Outside the pale of the Church (Emeritus)

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          and preach faith in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
          the Holy Ghost; but nowhere save in the Catholic Church shall he be

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epist.</span></span>
          clii.). And yet, at least in the beginning, the Donatists were but
          schismatics; their heresy was of somewhat later growth. How much
          stronger, then, becomes St. Augustine's argument when applied to
          the Established Church of our times, in which heresy and
          free-thinking have ravaged whatever schism had spared! The pamphlet
          under notice in reality does but reëcho the holy Doctor's remarks.
          An outline of St. Patrick's life and faith, drawn from
          unimpeachable authorities, sets before us most clearly that the
          ancient Catholic Church of Ireland differed far more from the
          Church now usurping St. Patrick's Cathedral, than the ancient
          Catholic Church of Africa from the Donatist body. The personal
          history of our great apostle, his early training, his call to
          preach, his ecclesiastical studies, his mission from Rome, his
          doctrine about the Holy See, his essentially Catholic teaching, are
          all plainly and forcibly Set forth, and contrasted with the
          peculiarities of modern Protestantism. No candid mind can for a
          moment hesitate to conclude with the writer, that the restoration
          ceremony was <span class="tei tei-q">“a ghastly spectacle of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">unreality</span></em>. It was a joyous revel
          over a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          but not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the soul</span></em>. The beauty of early
          years, which is oftentimes observed to resume its place, in death,
          upon the face from which it had been long driven by weeks, or
          months, or, perhaps, years of pain, the beauty of graceful outline,
          and delicate feature, and placid, gentle expression—all that had
          come back; and the church seemed as if but yesterday finished. But
          the spirit of St. Patrick was not there; the creed which he taught
          was not there; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          the same conjugation, mood, and tense: When Joseph, in prison,
          asked the chief butler of Pharaoh to intercede for him with his

              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
